    <h2>Description</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb (450 g) ground beef (80% lean)</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp onion powder (optional)</li>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>4 slices of cheese (optional)</li>
        <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>Tomato slices</li>
        <li>Onion slices</li>
        <li>Pickles</li>
        <li>Ketchup</li>
        <li>Mustard</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Mix until just combined, being careful not to overwork the meat.
            Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and shape each into a patty about 3/4 inch thick. Make a small indentation in the center of each patty with your thumb to prevent it from puffing up during cooking.</li>
        <li>Preheat your grill to medium-high heat or a skillet over medium-high heat.
            Place the patties on the grill or skillet. Cook for about 4-5 minutes on the first side, then flip and cook for another 4-5 minutes on the other side, or until they reach your desired level of doneness.
            If adding cheese, place a slice on each patty during the last minute of cooking and cover to melt.</li>
        <li>While the patties are cooking, lightly toast the hamburger buns on the grill or in a toaster until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Spread your desired condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise) on the bottom half of each bun.
            Place a cooked patty on each bun.
            Top with lettuce, tomato slices, onion slices, and pickles.
            Cover with the top half of the bun.</li>
        <li>Serve the hamburgers immediately with your favorite sides like fries, chips, or a salad.</li>
    </ol>
