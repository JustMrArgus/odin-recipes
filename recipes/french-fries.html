        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Ingridients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large russet potatoes</li>
            <li>2-3 cups vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
            <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
            <li>Optional: additional seasonings (such as paprika, garlic powder, or pepper)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Recipe</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the potatoes (optional, some prefer to leave the skin on for texture and flavor).
            Cut the potatoes into evenly sized sticks, about 1/4 inch thick. Aim for uniformity so they cook evenly.</li>
            <li>Place the cut potatoes in a bowl of cold water. Soak for at least 30 minutes to remove excess starch, which helps them become crispier when fried.
            After soaking, drain the potatoes and pat them dry thoroughly with a clean kitchen towel or paper towels.</li>
            <li>In a deep fryer or a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat the vegetable oil to 325째F (165째C). Use a thermometer to maintain an accurate temperature.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, fry the potatoes for about 4-5 minutes. They should be cooked but not browned. This step cooks the potatoes through.
            Remove the potatoes from the oil using a slotted spoon and let them drain on paper towels. Allow them to cool for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Increase the oil temperature to 375째F (190째C).
            Fry the potatoes again in batches for another 2-3 minutes, or until they are golden brown and crispy.
            Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels.</li>
            <li>While still hot, sprinkle the fries with salt and any additional seasonings you prefer.</li>
            <li>Serve the French fries immediately with your favorite dipping sauces, such as ketchup, mayonnaise, or aioli.</li>
        </ol>
